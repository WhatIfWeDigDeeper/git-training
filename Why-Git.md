[Guiding principles and implications](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git)
* Speed
  * -> _(almost) everything is local_
* Simple design
  * -> [_snapshots_ not deltas](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
  * -> _Once committed to Git, hard to lose work as Git generally adds data_
* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
  * -> _painless branching_
* Fully distributed
  * -> _full history cloned locally_
* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
  * data size -> compression, pointers to same object
  * integrity -> everything checksummed
