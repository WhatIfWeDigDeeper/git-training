**Three Main Areas** [from ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)

Question:  Why are there three areas instead of two?

Is there actually a fourth area?  If so, what is it?

When using a git command, ask yourself two questions:

1. "How does the command move information" across the three areas?
1. "How does this command change the Repository?"
