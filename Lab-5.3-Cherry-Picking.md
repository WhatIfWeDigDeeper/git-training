[5.3 Distributed Git - Maintaining a Project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Maintaining-a-Project#_rebase_cherry_pick)

"A _**cherry-pick**_ in Git is like a rebase for a single commit. It takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tries to reapply it on the branch you’re currently on... useful if you have a number of commits on a topic branch and you **want to integrate only one of them**"

    git cherry-pick #sha1

_Why does it create a new sha1?_
