# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a **Git training course** — a collection of Markdown documents that teach Git concepts through chapters, labs, and a quiz. There is no application code, build system, or test suite.

The course follows the structure of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), covering chapters 1-3, 5, and 7. The README.md serves as the table of contents linking to all materials.

## Content Structure

- **README.md** — Course table of contents and navigation hub
- **Chapter-*-Goals.md** — Learning objectives per chapter
- **Lab-*.md** — Hands-on exercises (numbered to match Pro Git chapters/sections)
- **quiz.md** — End-of-course assessment
- **diagrams/** — PNG images referenced by lab materials
- **Why-Git.md, Git-Configuration.md, Git-Aliases.md, etc.** — Concept explainers

## Conventions

- All content is Markdown with no front matter or templating
- Labs reference a practice repo that students clone separately
- Internal links use relative paths (`./filename.md`)
- The `diagrams/` folder contains screenshot PNGs, not generated diagrams
